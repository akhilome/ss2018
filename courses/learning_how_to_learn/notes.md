# Learning How To Learn

This course (offered [through Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)) is divided into weeks, 4 to be specific, and I'd be taking my notes based on that arrangement.

So, here goes:

## Week 1

_Interesting bullets from this week_:

* There are two types of thinking; **Focussed** and **Diffuse** thinking.

* Employ the pomodoro technique to combat procrastination.

* Practice makes permanent -- constant practice, especially of abstract concepts, is crucial to ingraining new concepts into one's brain.

* The two major memory systems touch on; Working memory & Longterm memory.

* Employ _spaced repetition_ to move and cement learned concepts from the working memory (shortterm) to the longterm memory.

* "_All lot of success in Life is [due to] passion and persistence_". -- Dr. T. Sejnowski.
