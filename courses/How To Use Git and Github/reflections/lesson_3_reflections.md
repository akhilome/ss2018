# Reflections For Lesson 3

The lesson 3 of the course is focussed loosely around how to use GitHub.

Here, one gets introduced to the GitHub platform and the concept of GitHub being a remote to your local repo is introduced early on in the lesson.

As always, here are the major concepts touched on during this lesson:

* git push
* git pull

And the reflections:

### Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git? Automatically pull changes from origin? Well, that might be a bad idea in my opinion, and here's why:

Since pulling from remote updates local, some changes to the repo made on local which you **want** to keep might get lost if git takes control of pulling.

### Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

First, brief descriptions:

Forks or rather forking, is like cloning, but for GitHub. Forks can not be created locally. Forking clones the repo of another user into your GitHub account.

Clones, or cloning literally means just that, cloning. A clone of a remote repo can be downloaded from the remote server (GitHub) using the 'git clone' command.

Branches, as have been previously discussed, are neither clones nor forks in the literal GitHub sense, but are sort of like mini-clones but within a particular repo. When a new branch is created, the branch is contained within the same repo as it was created.

_**FYI**, I typed this particular reflection half awake. Good night!_
