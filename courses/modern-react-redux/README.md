# Modern React and Redux

This course by Stephen Grider [on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) goes into detail about building frontend applications using Facebook's React library, and Redux for state management.

A lot was covered in the course and key highlights would be outline below at a future date - when I'm most likely done with the course, and doing a recap for "reconsolidation".
