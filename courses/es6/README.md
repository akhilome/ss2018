# ES6 - Javascript Improved

This course is a free course offered by Udacity (accessible [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/es6-javascript-improved--ud356)) which aims to introduce Javascript learners to what the relatively new Javascript Spec (ES6) brings to the table.

Generally, the course is divided into 4 lessons, with each lesson handling a group of core concepts introduced with the 'new' spec. These 4 lessons are:

* Syntax,
* Functions, 
* Built Ins, 
* "Developer FU".

As I go through each lesson, this README would be updated with a brief overview of what was learnt in each lesson and my study notes would be added to this folder.
