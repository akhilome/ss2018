# Week 1

A few things to note as well: 

* Source code => [compiler] => Machine Code
* One must recompile after making changes to the source code
* C is **not** dynamically typed!
* CLI - **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface
* I can now stop using `rm -r dir/` to remove directories in bash now as `rmdir dir/` would work just fine too
* Use prototyping to make the compiler aware of functions which may exist further down the source code
