# Week 3

* Pointers are just addresses. Addresses to locations in memory where variables 'live'.
* File pointers - used for working with files.
* Pointers provide an alternative way to pass data between functions.
* Anytime memory is being talked about, RAM is memory being referenced not HDD or SDD.
* Different data types take up different sizes in memory VIZ:
  * int - 4 bytes
  * char - 1 byte
  * float - 4 bytes
  * double - 8 bytes
  * long long - 8 bytes
* Pointers generally are data items whose 'value' is a memory address and whose type describe the data located at that memory address.
* Arrays are just pointers -- the name of an array, specifically, is a pointer.
* Pointers can be 'dereferenced'.
* **GOOD HABIT**: set pointers to `NULL` if on declaration, a meaningful address isn't set, yet.
* Pointers can be used to access blocks of dynamically allocated memory at runtime.
* Dynamically allocated memory comes from the heap
* `malloc()`
* Hexa-f**king-decimals!
* Locations in memory are hexadecimally identified.
