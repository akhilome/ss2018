# Speed Study 2018

Let's see how much code I can learn within the space of a year.

## Plan

Pretty straightforward. 

Per [P1xt's lead](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy), I'd be delibrately studying a particular course path for as long as I can every day for a full year (2018) and see how much 'points' I can rack up by the end of the year.

The course path of choice is the Job Ready Guide - [Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md)

## Goal

To have built a minimum of 4 fully functional web apps by 31st of December 2018.

## Progress

Current Course: [How to Use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)  
Courses Completed: 1  
Total Points earned: 100
