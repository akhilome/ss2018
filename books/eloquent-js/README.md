# Eloquent Javascript

With this book, available freely [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), I seek to polish the rough edges of my basic grasp on the language in general. 

Because I am already comfortable coding Javascript, a lot of the material presented as I traverse the book would not be entirely new to me. If, however, I come across a concept which is somewhat foreign to me, or something which I only 'barely' just know, I'd be sure to note them down.

In that sense, the sections which follow are those concepts I described in the previous paragraph, organized by chapters.

## Introduction

* First 12 chapters: discusses the javascript language
* Next 7 chapters: discusses web browsers and the way javascript is used to program them
* Final 2 chapters: dicusses NodeJs
* In addition to exercises which accompany each chapter, there are five (5) projects to be built VIZ:
  * Delivery robot,
  * Programming Language,
  * Platform game,
  * Pixel Paint program,
  * Dynamic website

## Chapters 1 & 2

* Special numbers in Javascript:
  * `Infinity`
  * `-Infinity`
  * `NaN`

* `NaN !== NaN`
* Short circuit evaluation with `||` and `&&`
* Using the `break` keyword within a loop stops the looping control flow and moves on the next statement in the program, if any.
* the `continue` keyword within a loop while somewhat similar to `break` does a fundamentally different thing. It causes causes control to jump out of the current iteration and continue with the next.
