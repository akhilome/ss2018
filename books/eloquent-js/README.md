# Eloquent Javascript

With this book, available freely [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), I seek to polish the rough edges of my basic grasp on the language in general. 

Because I am already comfortable coding Javascript, a lot of the material presented as I traverse the book would not be entirely new to me. If, however, I come across a concept which is somewhat foreign to me, or something which I only 'barely' just know, I'd be sure to note them down.
