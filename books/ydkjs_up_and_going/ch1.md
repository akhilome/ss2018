# Into Programming 

This chapter in the book mainly discusses common programming stuff beginners should be well aware of and versed with when starting out. The major things covered in this chapter include:

* What expressions and statements are in programming,

* Different operators which can be used when writing your programs,

* Importance of commenting your code as you write your programs and how to properly make those comments,

* What variables are and how they help programmers keep track of things as the program progresses,

* 

Some important concepts I grabbed from this chapter which I have not encountered before include:

* JS variables as constants are usually capitalized and have underscores between multiple words. For example: `var SPECIFIC_WEIGHT = 22.68;`

*
